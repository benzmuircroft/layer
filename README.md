a shared object that each user has a part in but can be replaced by others by transferring the role to the first in-line user

```js

const layer = {
  hyperswarm, // replication and rpc
  status: {} // if a store should be replaced
  stores: {
    a: store,
    b: store
  },
  methods: {}, // things they can do together
  shared: {} // maybe an autobase
};
```
